# Joshua Friedman Structure of Programming Languages Project
In this project I wrote code in both C++ and Python that reversed a string, in order to showcase the differences between C++ and Python. I focused on three different concepts that 
showcase the differences between them. The concepts are: Garbage Collection, Variable Typing, and Entry Point.

# Garbage Collection
Garbage Collection is when an automatic process, known as a garbage collector, frees up memory that a program does not reference again.

# Variable Typing
Depending on the language variables can be either dynamically typed or statically typed.

- Dynamic Typing:
  - Types are assigned at runtime based on what type of value the variable contains. Therefore, types do not need to be explicitly stated. 

- Static Typing:
  - Types are assigned at the time of compilation and therefore must be explicitly stated.


# Entry Point
The entry point of a program is the point where execution begins, and the program is given access to command line arguments.

# For information about each program
See the read me files in each folder.
