# C++ Reverse String
This code takes a string as an input from the user and reverses it. The program will continue to reverse user inputted strings until the user types the word "exit". At this point 
the program will exit. 

# Getting Started
In order to run the program for yourself, follow these steps.

# Built Using

# To Run the Code for Yourself
1. Use g++ to compile the program by typing the following in the terminal:
```
g++ ReverseString.cpp -o ReverseString
```
2. Run the Program
```
./ReverseString
```

# Output
The expected output is something similar to this:
```
Input a string to be reversed, or type exit to quit:
Hello World
The reversed string is: dlroW olleH
Input a string to be reversed, or type exit to quit:
Reverse
The reversed string is: esreveR
Input a string to be reversed, or type exit to quit:
exit
```

# Garbage Collection in C++
Garbage collection is not supported in C++. Memory management in C++ is done manually. With the programmer defining dynamic variables and deleting them when they are done being 
used 

# Variable Typing in C++
Variables in C++ are statically typed. Therefore, the typing of each variable is determined at the time of compilation and must be explicitly stated by the programmer.

# Entry Point in C++ 
The programmer must specify the entry point in a C++ program by defining a main function. This main function will serve as the entry point where the program is given access
to command line prompts.
