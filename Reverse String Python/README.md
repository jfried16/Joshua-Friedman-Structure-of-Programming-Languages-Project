# Python Reverse String
This code takes a string as an input from the user and reverses it. The program will continue to reverse user inputted strings until the user types the word "exit". At this point 
the program will exit. 

# Getting Started
In order to run the program for yourself, follow these steps.

# Built Using

# To Run the Code for Yourself
Open the terminal and input:
```
py reversestring.py
```

# Output
The expected output is something similar to this:
```
Input a string to be reversed, or type exit to quit:
Hello World
The reversed string is:
dlroW olleH
Input a string to be reversed, or type exit to quit:
Goodbye
The reversed string is:
eybdooG
Input a string to be reversed, or type exit to quit:
exit
```

# Garbage Collection in Python
Garbage Collection is handled automatically in Python. It uses both reference count and generational garbage collection to do this for the programmer automatically. 

# Variable Typing in Python
Variables in Python are dynamically typed. This means that the varible is given a type at runtime based on what type of information it holds. This means that the programmer does 
not need to explicitly state the type of a variable. 

# Entry Point in Python 
The entry point in Python is the first line of code by default. This is because Python is a scripted language that reads code line by line.
